Framework, data and results of the twitter analysis of "social bots, fake news and filter bubbles"

You can find the [slides](docs/slides_social_bots.pdf) and the [video](https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9268-social_bots_fake_news_und_filterblasen) (both in german) of the [34C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) [talk](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/Fahrplan/events/9268.html) online.

## libraries

The core of the twitter scraper is in the [`lib`](lib) folder.

## example 1: Searching for Hashtags/Words

- code is in [`bin/hashtags`](bin/hashtags)
- resulting data is in [`data/hashtags`](data/hashtags)

## What about the other data?

Well, I was sure it would be much easier to publish the data. But basically there are 3 problems:

1. I’m not allowed to publish raw data, because it violates the Twitter Developer Guidelines.
2. I couldn’t find cheap storage.
3. It's hard work, I usually try to focus on 20 projects simultanously, so I don't know what you need. 

At least I published the metadata of 1.6 million german Twitter accounts: https://zenodo.org/record/1135171

So here is the deal:

**If you need anything else, or if necessary data, code or documentation is missing, just open a GitHub issue and I’ll try to fix that!**
